feat: add AWS cloud deployment compatibility with migrations

Add comprehensive support for deploying to AWS cloud services while
preserving all existing local development functionality.

Migration System:
- Install sequelize-cli for production-grade database migrations
- Add .sequelizerc configuration for migration paths
- Create src/config/database.cjs for sequelize-cli compatibility
- Add initial migration for users table (20260207000001-create-users-table.cjs)
- Create migrations and seeders directory structure

Cloud Environment Detection:
- Add isCloudEnvironment detection in config (AWS, GCP, Azure, K8s)
- Auto-detect cloud platforms via environment variables
- Support AWS RDS SSL connections with DB_SSL flag
- Add SSL dialect options for secure RDS connections

Script Enhancements:
- Update init-db.ts to skip database creation in cloud environments
- Modify connection.ts to use migrations in production (no auto-sync)
- Add setup:cloud script for cloud deployment workflow
- Add migration management scripts (migrate, migrate:undo, migrate:status, migrate:create)
- Preserve local development with auto-sync in dev mode

Documentation:
- Add AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md with comprehensive deployment guide
- Include RDS setup instructions and environment variables
- Document migration workflow and troubleshooting
- Add comparison table for local vs cloud scripts

Package Changes:
- Add sequelize-cli as dev dependency
- Update setup script to include migrations
- Add new migration-related npm scripts

This change enables seamless deployment to AWS ECS, Elastic Beanstalk,
or EC2 with managed RDS databases, while maintaining the existing local
Docker-based development workflow.
